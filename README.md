'espresso_data' contains all of the data of the 20 spectra studied as well as the notebooks used to transpose the information in a complex table system of the fits format to plain ASCII text.

'Sun' contains an initial training test used to learn how to work with ARES and a basic analysis of a simple and small spectrum of the Sun.

'rejt_relation' has files numbered from 0 to 9 which are files returned by ARES (using the Sun test spectrum) with a rejt value ranging from 0.990 to 0.999 with a 0.001 step. It also contains a notebook
comparing the result for these different values.

'S1D' contains the notebooks for the first 6 S1D spectra as well as the data necessary to run them (in 'dados'). It also has a notebook named 'S1D_all_values' which was used to compare all of the data from the 
6 S1D spectra.

'S2D' contains the notebooks for the all of the S2D spectra (1 to 20) as well as the data necessary to run them (in 'data'). It also has a notebook named 'S2D_all_values' which was used to compare all of 
the data from the 20 S2D spectra. 'S2D_1' is in the directory '1'. 'values' contains the necessary data to run 'S2D_all_values'.
