This readme was created by Francisco:
The following folders present the exact same structure as Matilde's Folders, the difference being that the contents of the folders, the notebooks, are slightly 
altered. For the S1D spectra the alterations correspond strictly to the correction of the +f0 term and Sqrt(N) mistakes in the semi-group of 3741 lines, whilst
for the S2D spectra the alterations consist of new areas of code to determine the TOTDATA matrices, in both the start of the S2D notebooks and the end where the
3741 line semi-group is being treated. In the S2D spectra folder the data folders used are not found here due to github's restrictions, in case you need them,
contact me or the person responsible for the internship.
